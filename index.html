        will look and function the way you want.  Our short term goal is to

      <p>The mDevelopment team consists of two brothers, Matt and Donny.
        They work together to create awesome websites. We both graduated

        can’t figure out.</p>

      <h2>Meet Matt</h2>
      <p>Hello All, thanks again for coming to visit our site. I’m happy to see
        that you’ve made it this far. Here I will tell you a little bit of
        myself. I was born St. Paul, Minnesota in the year of 1981, and was a
        good looking baby.  In my free time I try to stay healthy by eating
        right and exercising. I also play World of Warcraft. In the winter
        months I love to snowboard, and in the summer months you will likely
        find my in or near the water.</p>
      <p>Life was tough for me in my early years up to after I graduated high
        school. I didn’t have a lot of friends and struggled in school. When I
        turned 30 I decided that if I wanted a life I could be proud of I
        needed to get a degree in my desired profession, Web Development.</p>
      <p>From there I enrolled at Rasmussen College in their Information
        Technology program with a major in Web Development. I choose Rasmussen
        because they offer 100% online courses which allowed me to continue
        working full-time at my CNC machinist job. I graduated in December 2014
        with an Associate’s Degree at the top of my class with a 3.98 GPA,
        which is my proudest accomplishment in my life. Regardless of where my
        career leads me I would like to pursue a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer
        Science.</p>
      <p>After I got my degree I did struggle to find a job, and after a lot of
        hard work and looking I got a job at EasyITGuys as their first web
        developer/administrator. My main objective there is to build and
        maintain WordPress sites. I do that be using the best plugins and
        themes to keep the look of the sites looking modern and awesome. I make
        sure that all our software, plugins, themes, and core WordPress stay
        up-to-date and trouble shoot any issues that arise. I also stay in
        direct contact with the EasyITGuys clients to make sure that they are
        satisfied with their website(s). Currently, I am managing 25 WordPress
        websites.</p>
      <p> After 9 months of being there they have already hired other web
        developers/interns that I am in charge of training and make sure they
        stay busy. I also do some work with our dedicated server and Office
        365.</p>
      <p>Though I really enjoying working with WordPress I also love to code
        custom sites. I want to become an expert in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript,
        JQuery, and keep up on all the new technologies. In short, my goal is
        to become the best front end web developer I can be.</p>
